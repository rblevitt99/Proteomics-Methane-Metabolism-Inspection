The goal of all this code is to take all KEGG identifiers associated with methane metabolism and 
merge them to the protoemics dataframe. This will tell me how methane metabolism changes across all conditions at the protein level. In this repo I have the 
python code to generate dataframes and R code to generate informative figures.
